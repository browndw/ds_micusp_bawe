# DocuScope Corpus Analysis

This repository houses the code and data used by Emily DeJeu and David Brown for their chapter in *Between Invention and Audience: DocuScope and the Rhetorical Approach to Corpus Analysis*.

The repository contains an R Project file that can be open and used open the RMarkdown file and run the code.

All plots and **.csv** files are written out into the **output** folder. If run correctly, no paths should require resetting.

The included code requries both the **[biber.mda](https://github.com/browndw/mda.biber)** package and references (though doesn't require) the **[pseudobibeR](https://github.com/browndw/pseudobibeR)** package.
